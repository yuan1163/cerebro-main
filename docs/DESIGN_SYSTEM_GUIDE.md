# Design System

The library of basic building blocks are based on Functional Components and CSS Modules. When developing the system, we tried to follow the naming convention and design patterns of [MUI](https://mui.com/core/). But in order to simplify code, we have a much shorter list of props. Simplified API gives us more control over the markup and the styling of the UI components.
